two pointer approach
1. Given an array of sorted integers, find 2 numbers such that they add up to a target number.
    How does my input look like.
    Will the sum cause integer overflow.

    approach 1 - Brute force algorithm(O n^2)
        2 for loop iterate through to find target sum.

    approach 2 - O nlogn > O n^2
        sorting an array and scanning 

    If it is already a sorted array then we can go with binary search.
